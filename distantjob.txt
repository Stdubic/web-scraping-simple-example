A lot of stuff sold can be called over priced tat. Apple is not tat, but it is very much overpriced. Bit like Parker and Papermate pens, or Dyson and Vax. Both as good as each other, but one is for show as much as functionality ...

I love Apple products, and the Apple watch is not just beautiful, but the next step in technology and wearable devices. I do wonder though who it will sell with the younger types. Watches are not as popular with them, especially high priced ones. I also think Apple made a huge mistake by not selling it through the Carrier channel. Most people get their iPhones & iPads through their carriers because of the heavily subsidized price or the ability to buy the device outright, interest free over 12 or 24 months. The mid-range Apple Watch is just priced too high for cash buyers, especially if you have to also upgrade to iPhone 6.

Sick to death of DM posting US tech news as if it's relevant in the UK. It's not. How many UK hotels will this work in? How many UK stores accept Apple Pay? Oh right, none. Thanks for informing me.

It's useless without an iPhone.

"Thing of beauty"? It's just a rectangular slab with a strap, and I'm certain if any other company had designed it then it would barely raise an eyebrow. Why are reporters so besotted with Apple products?
